# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
Overall I like model B because it was concise but also included the necessary answer without adding too much information.

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
Model A and Model B were the most similar in terms of accuracy and concise. The most different would be Model A and Model C because in terms of concise model C was a lot longer than Model A.

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
I was surprised with Model C's creativity with the new word.

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
I think accuracy and conciseness are the most important for evaluating a chatbot/model.
